In This Release
===============

This file describes the code structure of Lanner platform comport 
program.  This package provides program(DOS/Linux/FreeBSD) and driver
(Linux/FreeBSD) for Lanner platform-specific function.
Separated makefile available as well.(Makefile.dos, Makefile.linux,
Makefile.freebsd)

For DOS environment, Use DJGPP as compiler., use DJGPP and Makefile.dos.

For Linux, supports kernel versions 2.4.x and 2.6.x and 3.x, use Makefile.linux.

For FreeBSD, it is tested under FreeBSD 9.0.


This release provide 2 ways(Defined in Makefile) to access Lanner platform
devices:

1. DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=0(Default):

   To access Lanner miscellaneous devices through lanner driver.
   Lanner driver is available in bin sub-directory after make.
   This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time. Lanner is
   not supplying patches against the kernel source to allow for static linking
   of the driver.

   Note: This mode is enabled by set DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=0 in Makefile.

2. DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=1:

   To manipulate Lanner miscellaneous device by userland application direct
   accessing. This mode JUST FOR providing quick way for user to realize
   Lannner platform specific function. This mode supported on DOS and Linux.

   Note: This mode is enabled by set DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=1 in Makefile.



Building
========

To build, 3 steps to accomplish it:

1. Identify current OS and select proper Makefile. 
   Copy Makefile.(os) to Makefile.

2. Select access mode(DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=[0|1] by edit Makefile.

3. Just type make to build, once completed, bin sub-directory contains.



Installation
============

To installation, depend on what's access mode you set:

If DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=1, no driver is need. Just execute executable program in
bin sub-directory to handle watchdog/bypass function.


If DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=0 , driver is needed.
For Linux:
        Insert module and create node in /dev as below example:
        #insmod cp_drv.[k]o
        #mknod /dev/cp_drv c 247 0

For FreeBSD:
        Insert module as below example:
        #kldload -v ./cp_drv.ko




Usage
=====
Once build completed, application(and driver) is available in bin sub-directory.

The command usage will be printout when you execute cp_tst without any argument.
Below list usage:

        help message
        a=Super Io, b=lower card, c=upper card
        0~1=Super Io number, 0~7=card number
        0=rs232, 1=rs485, 2=rs422/485
        0=Termination disable, 1=Termination enable
        for example: [cp_tst --a 2 1 0] represent:
        Super Io number is 2,  transmission mode is rs485, Termination is disable
        for example: [cp_tst --c 6 2 1] represent:
        upper card number is 6,  transmission mode is rs422/485, Termination is enable
        for example: [cp_tst --c 2] represent: show mode and termination of upper card port 2
        for example: [cp_tst --a 1] represent: show mode and termination of super io port 1

Note for Linux user: insmod driver if necessary.

Q&A:
====
Q:
  How can I set superIo port 1 to rs232, Termination to enable 
A:
  ./cp_tst --a 1 0 1


Q:
  How can I set lower card port 1 to rs232, Termination to enable 
A:
  ./cp_tst --b 1 0 1

Q:
  How can I show lower card port 1 status 
A:
  ./cp_tst --b 1
